Simple command line tool for listing started Pivotal stories that you're working on. The idea is that this tool makes it easier to mention story numbers in your git commits.

Instructions:
Rename .pvt.sample to .pvt, fill it in with your personal details, place it in your home directory, then run pvt.rb. That's it!
